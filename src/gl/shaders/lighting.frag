// header.vert declares these for the vertex stage and header.frag does not
// declare them at all, because until per-pixel lighting nothing in a fragment
// shader needed a light. This is prepended to the fragment shader of the
// per-pixel programs only; every other program is unchanged.
//
// Nothing has to be uploaded twice to make this work. A uniform of the same
// name declared in both stages is ONE uniform in the linked program, and
// gl3shader.cpp resolves every location by name against the whole program, so
// gl3device.cpp's existing setUniform calls reach here as they are.
//
// The Object block must match header.vert's member for member, including
// u_world and u_lightPosition, which nothing below reads. std140 lays a block
// out by declaration and not by use, so dropping the unused members would move
// the ones that are used.
