rem Sets DXC to a shader compiler that can emit SPIR-V.
rem
rem The dxc.exe in the Windows SDK cannot: it is built without SPIR-V codegen and
rem says so when asked for -spirv. The Vulkan SDK's can, and so can the release
rem builds at https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/releases.
rem
rem Set DXC to one of those to pick it outright. Otherwise the Vulkan SDK's is
rem used when VULKAN_SDK is set.
rem
rem Called by the make_*.cmd beside this file. Sets DXC in the caller's
rem environment, so the caller must not have run setlocal first.
